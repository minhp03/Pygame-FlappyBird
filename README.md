Flappy Bird game using Python

ðŸ§  What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in game development, including managing game loops, event handling.

I learned how to use Pygame to render graphics, implement object physics (like gravity), and manage game states.

Debugging and balancing gameplay taught me problem-solving skills and the importance of smooth user experience. 

Overall, this project improved my Python skills and sparked my interest in game design.
